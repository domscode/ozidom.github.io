deep underground<br/>
cut from the days and the lights<br/>
didn't see what came over<br/>
was no feeling up there<br/>
there was something seeping<br/>
deep underground<br/>
think i heard you weeping<br/>
faded by the memory of light<br/>
taken by the memory of night<br/>
but the light that shines <br/>
shines above you<br/>
and the light that shines<br/> 
shines above you<br/>
deep underground<br/>

riddle: before the tears: you

feel4

I'm doing time
paid the price
with out hope or even sight
and i know, i know
that i feel for you

caught in the mine
down too far
can not make it any more
and i know, i know
that i feel for you

What can I do 
What can I say 
What can I do
to undo

the last time you know, find the last, then head north along the edge: were

Waiting here in the dark
Its easy when you feel
dont look, look done 
Its easy when you feel
Your love Your love
Easy when you feel
Your love Your love

Stuck down here all alone
Is easy when you feel
dont try to find
Its easy when you feel
Your love Your love
Easy when you feel 
Your love Your love

HINT:IF you go here at the start, and take the second half before moving in
