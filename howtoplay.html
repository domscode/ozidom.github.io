    <b>How to play the game</b><br>
    You need to descend to the 3rd level of the dungeon. Each level is protected by a Staircase that can only be descended by solving a riddle. The riddle is a word that is either hidden in the text of ths song/riddle or is a word in song. Hints are available via a bolded character in the song. It gives you an idea where the word begins or the search for the word. The following is an example of how to dipher the song and the riddle...<br/>
